What's the app idea? 
    I want to build a karaoke app for iOS. 
    It will connect to a bluetooth speaker and play music through it. 
    It will use the microphone to play the users voice through the speaker. 

Who is the target audience? Who will be using this app?
people who want to sing karaoke with their friends and family.

What are the core features? What are the 3-5 must-have features for the first version?
1. connect to bluetooth speaker
2. play music through speaker
3. play user's voice through speaker

Do you have design preferences? Any specific style, color schemes, or apps you'd like to draw inspiration from?
1. Modern UI design
2. green and black color scheme
3. buttons should be big and easy to press
4. require a button to start and stop the microphone

What's your experience level with iOS development? This helps me tailor the technical complexity of the plan.
I have no experience with iOS development.

What iOS technologies are you interested in using? For example:
SwiftUI (modern, declarative UI framework - recommended for new projects)
UIKit (traditional, imperative UI framework)
Any specific frameworks like CoreData, CloudKit, etc.?
not sure
